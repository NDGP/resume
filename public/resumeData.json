    "bio":"Music and tech have been my two passions for the past decade. I’ve recently graduated from Lighthouse Labs web development boot camp, a 3 month full time deep dive into wed dev. It was the most engaging educational endeavour I have ever taken part in and I cant wait to dig into new experiments with app development. Besides tech, I play in touring rock bands and have taken part in battle bots. Keep curious and thanks for your consideration.",
